"Well-known binary" (WKB) is a binary encoding that allows geometric data to be efficiently stored and transmitted.

WKB is a standard method for representing geometric objects such as `points`, `lines`, and `polygons` in binary form.
It's commonly used in the field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial databases.

This tool uses the <a href='https://github.com/cschwarz/wkx' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>wkx</a> package for conversions.


### WKB to GeoJSON

```ts
import wkx from 'wkx'

// wkbValue is your input value
const twkbBuffer = Buffer.from(wkbValue, 'hex')
const geometry = wkx.Geometry.parse(twkbBuffer)
const geoJson = geometry.toGeoJSON()
```

### GeoJSON to WKB

```ts
import wkx from 'wkx'

// geoJsonValue is your input JSON
const geometry = wkx.Geometry.parseGeoJSON(geoJsonValue)
const wkbString = geometry.toWkb().toString('hex')
```
